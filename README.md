# Dope Trader

Dope Trader is a turn-based commodity trading game.

You play the role of a drug dealer in debt. You have one month to trade drugs and repay your debt.

One day passes when you travel to a new location. Each day prices fluctuate due to market demand. When a drug is not in demand it cannot be traded.

Carrying more merchandise increases the risk of rival gang encounters. You can fight back and take their cash if you have guns. Your chance to hit a thug increases with each gun you carry.

Purchasing guns happens randomly when you go to a new location.

The game is inspired by the 1984 classic by John Dell, "Drug Wars".
